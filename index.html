<p>What kind of research do we want to do? A few rules of thumb can help us decide if we're chasing yet another shiny object, or something we truly believe in. Here's a start, and I think this will evolve.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>We work in the real, messy world.</strong> Our goal is to create technology that works at scale. Therefore, to the degree possible, we work with the entire complexity of the real world. For example, when we build an educational system, we want to see it used in real classrooms. This is messy, and takes a lot of work, but I think it furthers the impact it has on the world.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Theory-driven, but human-centered.</strong> We focus on the challenges and problems people face, and use theory to inspire solutions. We are less interested in building computational systems with the primary goal of testing theory, but are happy to collaborate with other scientists who want to extend our systems to build theory. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you work with me, I expect that you:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Take initiative</strong> Grad school is not designed to prepare you to be a better engineer, psychologist, or designer. It is designed to help you become a scientist. When we think of Edison, Bohr or Pasteur, we can't imagine they sat in a cubicle, and implemented solutions that others suggested, or solved problems others handed them. <em>They took initiative</em>. I think this is the defining quality of a scientist, and I expect you to do so everyday. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Follow the Christmas tree</strong> At Stanford's d.school, students are told to "bias towards action." I think this is great advice. But it elides that action must be punctuated by reflection. Instead, I like Bill Buxton's Christmas tree more.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Say no soon</strong> Students at a top university like CMU are surrounded by many exciting things, wouldn't you want to get involved? I encourage you to (again, take initiative). But make sure you don't lick every cookie on the plate. (That's not good for you, nor for your collaborators.) Instead, I suggest you prototype a number of different ideas, but once you've picked one, go after it with all your energy. <em>If you have trouble turning down potential collaborators, talk to me and I can help you out.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do a little every day</strong> Don’t fall for the gambler’s paradox, "today is turning out to be a waste, I'm not feeling productive; but tomorrow, I'll wake up early and I'll make up for my loss!" In general, I expect you to  If you're falling behind, talk to me early, and we can work things out.   Success compounds
Learn to communicate: do it well, and the world’s your audience. 
Write one skill you plan to improve each week. </p></li>
