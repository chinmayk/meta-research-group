<p>What kind of research do we want to do? A few rules of thumb can help us decide if we're chasing yet another shiny object, or something we truly believe in. Here's a start, and I think this will evolve.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>We work in the real, messy world.</strong> Our goal is to create technology that works at scale. Therefore, to the degree possible, we work with the entire complexity of the real world. For example, when we build an educational system, we want to see it used in real classrooms. This is messy, and takes a lot of work, but I think it furthers the impact it has on the world.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Theory-driven, but human-centered.</strong> We focus on the challenges and problems people face, and use theory to inspire solutions. We are less interested in building computational systems with the primary goal of testing theory, but are happy to collaborate with other scientists who want to extend our systems to build theory. </p></li>
</ul>
